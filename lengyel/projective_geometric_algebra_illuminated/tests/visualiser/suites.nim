## Check invariants of visualiser against deterministically sampled pool of RGA objects.
##
## Suites are named after visualiser's modules rather than Lengyel's chapters:
##   visualiser is tool built on library, not replication of published equations.
##
## Pool is drawn once from seeded generator, so failure reproduces from test name alone.
##   Points are sampled inside box drawn extent covers, so nothing is degenerate.
##   Lines and planes are joined from those points, so collinear cases stay improbable.
##
## `renderer`, `gui` and `panel` are absent, deliberately:
##   each needs live OpenGL context, which test runner has no business opening.
##   What they would test sits below them:
##   `mesh` holds tessellation, `scene` operations and formatting, `camera` transforms.
