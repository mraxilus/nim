## Run shared suite at capacities small enough that its tests reach them.
##
## Every capacity is `.define`; at defaults suite reaches limits only where test spells
## limit out. Shrinking them makes boundaries cheap to reach and makes any constant tuned
## to *default* rather than derived from define fail here. `LABEL_MAX` at 12 is sharpest:
## under length of several labels suite constructs, so truncation happens for real.
##
## Backend is C, matching desktop entry point: what varies is capacity, not render path;
## see `test_4d_browser.nim` for other axis.
