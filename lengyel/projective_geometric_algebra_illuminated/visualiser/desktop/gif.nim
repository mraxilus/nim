## Encode sequence of framebuffer readbacks as short looping animated GIF.
##
## GIF is written out by hand, as PNG is in `image.nim`.
##   Container below compression is handful of length- or count-tagged blocks.
##   GIF's compression is LZW rather than deflate, so no system codec carries it.
##   Encoder below is small enough to write directly, on same "depend only where
##   genuinely external" line `image.nim` draws.
## Every frame is quantized to one fixed colour cube, six levels per channel.
##   One integer divide per channel, no per-pixel palette search.
##   Runs only for storyboard's diagnostic capture, never in draw loop.
##
##   |-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
##   | Block                 | Carries                                                |
##   |-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
##   | Logical Screen        | Canvas size and one global colour table.              |
##   | Application Extension | `NETSCAPE2.0` loop-forever marker.                    |
##   | Graphic Control (each) | This frame's hold time.                               |
##   | Image Descriptor      | This frame's LZW-compressed, quantized pixels.        |
##   |-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
##
## Rows arrive bottom-up, as OpenGL reads them, and are flipped while being quantized.
##   As `image.nim` flips them while filtering, so no separate copy exists.
## Every scratch buffer comes from caller-owned frame arena, or is fixed-capacity table
## reset per call.
##   Quantized indices, LZW dictionary, packed output; nothing calls allocator.
##
## Desktop-only; unreachable from browser build. See `visualiser.nim`'s "Render Paths".
