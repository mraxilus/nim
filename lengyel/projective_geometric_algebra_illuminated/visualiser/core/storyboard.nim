## Replay construction one operation per step, for capture without hand on mouse.
##
## Each step goes through same `applyOperation` and `addItem` GUI's apply button calls, so
## exported frames show what clicking would have produced.
##   Doubles as visual regression harness: frames are comparable between builds.
## Steps name operands by index into scene, which is dense and grows by one per step, so
## index is stable once written.
##   Seeds occupy indices 0 to 4; every later index is step that produced it.

##   |       |                   |   step 08) so it has something to project onto.  |
##   | 4     | ground            | Seed plane, joined from three points at z = 0.   |
