## Turn geometry into picture: read what object is through algebra, place every point of
## its drawing through algebra, and hand plain places down to `mesh` to pack into vertices.
##
## **Geometry side of drawing.** Owns what thing is and where it stands -- scene object,
## lattice line of ground grid, world axis, and everything at horizon, where point becomes
## star, line becomes great circle of directions it stands for, and plane becomes whole
## sky. Those are geometric objects placed through library, which project exists to
## exercise.
##
## Does *not* own picture drawn to stand for them. Disc is not plane and ribbon is not
## line: both are stand-ins sized for eye, built in `mesh` out of ordinary arithmetic. See
## `euclid.nim` header for split, and `boundary.nim` for one place two languages meet.
##
## Finite objects are tessellated about support point, i.e. point nearest origin; objects
## at horizon are drawn fixed to `DrawExtent.eye` at `DrawExtent.radius_horizon`, so
## orbiting or dollying leaves each in same apparent direction, as real star would.
##
## Shared by desktop (`visualiser.nim`) and browser (`browser_bridge.nim`) render paths.
