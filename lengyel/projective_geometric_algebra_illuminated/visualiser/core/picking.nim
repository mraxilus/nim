## Test scene items against cursor, so mouse action knows which object it touched.
##
## Every world-space derivation goes through algebra: rays as joins, hits as meets, depths
## as `depthAgainst`, nearest points and clips by library's operators.
##   Only *pixel* half of test is screen math: point or line is judged by pixel distance
##   to its projection, rasterisation question.
##   Line's endpoints are assembled as `tessellate.addLine` draws them, so hit agrees with
##   what is drawn.
## Plane is tested through algebra rather than around it.
##   Cursor's sight ray is RGA line (eye ∧ heading) met with plane directly, `ray ∨ plane`,
##   giving exact point struck.
##   Screen-space quad projection is trap: corner near eye sends its projection to
##   infinity, and point-in-polygon on blown-up quad accepts cursor nowhere near plane.
##   Meet in 3D fails cleanly (ray parallel, hit behind eye) instead of wrongly.
