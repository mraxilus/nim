##   `visualiser.fillSceneForBenchmark` builds for `--timings` deliberately does not.
## Three sizes of one arrangement, so cost reads as slope rather than single number.
##   `ScaleOrrery.Nearest` (60), `Neighbourhood` (360, default) and `Catalogue` (5038,
##   two slots short of pool). Every one is same construction truncated at different depth.
## Also claim about world.
##   Every system but ours is real star known to carry planets, at real distance in real
##   direction, carrying planets it really has at real relative distances.
##     From `neighbourhood.nim`, shipped snapshot of NASA Exoplanet Archive;

##   Line is infinite, so each crosses entire frame; more read as line traffic.
## Four objects at horizon, two of them points because only one can make plane.
##   Earth lies in Sol's ecliptic, so `att(sol ∧ earth)` sits *on* line at horizon
##   ecliptic gives.
##   Luna's ring is tipped out of it, so `att(earth ∧ luna)` sits off that line and spans
##   plane at horizon with it. See horizon block in `constructOrrery`.
## `itemsOf(scale)` items on nose at every size, asserted.
##   Walk passes over system too large for room left rather than stopping on it.

    ##   One width for all: real extents differ enormously, but at this scale difference

    ##   Sol and Proxima, two of three hundred and thirty-two.

  RADIUS_MOON_FURTHEST = 0.32
    ## Fix how far nearest and furthest moon ring parents, in world units.
    ##   Small, necessarily: tightest planet pair, Venus and Earth, stands 0.74 apart, so
    ##   moon ring wider than third of that reaches next orbit.
    ##     Moon is dot beside planet at opening camera and separate body once reader goes
    ##     and looks.
    ##   Range rather than single multiple: twenty-one moons need range to map onto.

  TILT_MOON = 0.0897
    ## Fix how far moon's ring leans out of planet's orbital plane, in radians.
    ##   Luna's real inclination to ecliptic, 5.14 degrees.
    ##     One figure for every moon: real inclinations are all small, and one that has
    ##     to be right is Luna's.

  SHIFT_SOL = 1.0
    ## Fix how far `radiusOfSolBody`'s logarithm is lifted before normalising.
    ##   Without it Mercury lands at radius zero, *inside* Sol.

    ##   dots at framed camera.

  AU_NEIGHBOUR_NEAREST = 0.01
    ## Fix nearest semi-major axis neighbour ring's logarithm is scaled from.
    ##   Real planets come far closer to stars than Mercury does, so scale cannot start
    ##   where Sol's does.
    ##   Clamped: below this planet is drawn at ring's inner limit, honest about drawing
