## Turn RGA objects into records and vertices renderer can draw, natively or in browser.
##
## Finite objects are tessellated about support point, i.e. point nearest origin.
##   Line becomes segment along its attitude: `DrawExtent.radiusHorizon` backward from
##   support, same radius forward from eye, so forward end lands exactly on
##   `eye + radius_horizon*axis`, where horizon marker for its attitude would be drawn.
##   Plane becomes flat translucent disc at fixed radius (`EXTENT_PLANE`) plus rim marking
##   its edge, spanned by own frame.
##     Fixed rather than camera-relative, so plane holds one size in world units as
##     camera dollies or orbits.
## Object at horizon (infinitely far, no support point) is drawn fixed to `DrawExtent.eye`
## at `DrawExtent.radiusHorizon`, near far clip plane.
##   Point becomes marker standing in fixed direction; line becomes great circle of
##   directions its pencil spans; plane, unique universal whole-sky object every plane at
##   horizon is, becomes dome over entire sky.
##   Fixed to eye rather than origin, so orbiting or dollying leaves each in same apparent
##   direction, as real stars would.
## World furniture (ground grid, world axes) reaches `DrawExtent.extentFurniture`.
##   Tied to far clip distance rather than orbit distance (`extentFurnitureFor`), so it
##   reads as extending indefinitely.
##   Drawn as fog about eye (`fogFurnitureFor`): solid nearby, faded to nothing at that
##   reach, laid wherever camera has flown.
##   Finite *line object* reaches same extent from own support, since it is content and
##   not reference.
## Storage is fixed and owned by caller: meshes are cleared and refilled every frame.

    Algebra, ## Debug layer drawing multivectors frame computed, in true form.

      ##   Worn by rubber-band of drag over pair that makes nothing
      ##   (`interaction.inkOfDrag`), warning arriving before release.
      ##   Never leaned on alone: magenta reads as blue under deuteranopia, so that drag
      ##   also shows no ghost.
    ## Categorical slots, spent by caller on telling one object from another.
    ##   Named by hue rather than role, as caller alone knows what objects mean.
    ##     Grade is legible from shape, so colour carries identity.
    ##   Declared in this order for cycling: consecutive names sit far apart on wheel, so

    ##   deficiency.
    ##   Five slots, not sixteen and not eight.
