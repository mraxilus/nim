## Say what every gesture, button and key in this visualiser does, once, for both UIs.
##
## Desktop wrote this in its panel and browser in hint that vanished after four seconds;
## two had drifted.
##   Both render this table, so control gaining binding is described in one place or in
##   neither.
## Entries name *user's* action and its outcome, in reader's words, not handler.
##   "Drag one object onto another", not "pointerdown then pointermove".
##   Binding derived from rule stated elsewhere is read from there: `lut_help_entries`
##   builds construct rows out of `interaction.armingOf`, so rebinding button rewrites help.
## Every row has to make sense with rows above it covered up.
##   Reader opens one tab, finds line they need, leaves.
##   Three failures, found by reading rendered panel cold.
##     Circular: "drag one object onto another" → "make whatever the two of them make".
##     Leaning on neighbour: "the same choice, without needing the other button".
##     Naming internals reader never met: "the apply section", "dolly".
##   What row cannot carry (which menu, what wedge is) goes in `descriptionOf`.
## One word, one meaning: objects are *selected*, operations are *chosen*.
## Cut by how reader is working, not by what control is.
##   Reader opens this mid-task, and only that task's rows are of use.
##   `HelpPath` is axis, one tab per path; `ENTRIES_MAX_PATH` holds each tab to what fits
##   phone without scrolling, checked at compile time.
##     Cost: table that outgrows tab fails build until path is split or bound is raised.
##
## Shared between desktop (`visualiser.nim`) and browser (`browser_bridge.nim`) render
## paths; see `visualiser.nim`'s "Render Paths" table.

const
  ENTRIES_MAX_PATH_CATALOGUE* = COUNT_OPERATION
    ## Bound `operations` path at exactly size of catalogue it lists.
    ##   Not height: this tab *is* catalogue, one row per operation, and only bound worth
    ##   checking is that it holds every one.
    ##   Scrolls on any screen; reference list read by lookup.

  ENTRIES_MAX_PATH_KEYS* = 12
    ## Bound how many entries `keys` path may hold, checked at compile time.
    ##   Larger than other paths': keyboard tab describes what phone-sized viewport lacks, so
    ##   fitting it there is wrong trade; measurement in `PROVENANCE.md`.
    ##   Bound stays so tab cannot grow unnoticed; raising it is deliberate.

  ENTRIES_MAX_PATH* = 8
    ## Bound how many entries any other path may hold, checked at compile time.
    ##   Proxy: real constraint is *rendered height*, and count is what compile time checks.
    ##   Measured on 320x568 viewport, each tab asked how far its rows overflow box given;
    ##   figures in `PROVENANCE.md`.
    ##     `select` scrolls by one row; trade taken for two rows teaching bindings reader
    ##     cannot discover otherwise, after shortening recovered too little.
    ##     `keys` scrolls and is left scrolling; see `ENTRIES_MAX_PATH_KEYS`.
    ##     Other five fit exactly, two only after descriptions were cut.
    ##   Count of rows is not count of lines; path nearing cap prompts re-measurement, never
    ##   trust in number.
    ##   Cap forces question to be asked again, not promise nothing scrolls.
    ##     Splitting path is nearly always better than raising; not here, since regrouping
    ##     keyboard rows onto tabs whose work they do overflowed `camera` and `select`.
