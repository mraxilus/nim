## Only projection is left to convention.
##   Perspective divide, depth range and clip volume belong to graphics pipeline rather
##   than to geometry, so they are written out directly.
## Placement is spherical about target, since that is what mouse drag turns.
##   Elevation is clamped short of poles, where up direction would run along sight axis
##   and joins above would collapse.
##
## Shared by desktop (`visualiser.nim`) and browser (`browser_bridge.nim`) render paths.

# Reorder so placement reads before frame derived from it, though `pan` calls `frame`.
#   Constants below stay in dependency order regardless, as reordering does not cover them.

#[ Camera Configuration ]#

const
  UP_WORLD* = Direction(x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 1.0)
    ## Fix world's up direction, which azimuth turns about and elevation rises from.
  ELEVATION_LIMIT* = 0.5*PI - 0.02
    ## Bound elevation short of pole, where sight axis would run along `UP_WORLD`.
  DISTANCE_LIMIT_NEAR* = 0.05
    ## Bound how close eye may orbit to target, through `distanceHeld`.
    ##   Only bound on where camera may stand.
    ##     At orbit distance zero eye coincides with target, sight axis is undefined, and
    ##     every direction `frame` derives collapses.
    ##   No far bound: nothing downstream needs ceiling.
    ##     Clip planes are fractions of orbit distance (`FACTOR_CLIP_NEAR`,
    ##     `FACTOR_CLIP_FAR`), so frustum keeps shape, and grid bounds own line count
    ##     (`tessellate.CELLS_GRID_HALF_MAX`).
    ##     What degrades far out is `Vertex`'s float32 storage: past roughly million
    ##     units coordinate carries under tenth of unit.
  FACTOR_CLIP_FAR* = 20.0
    ## Set far clip plane this many orbit distances out.
    ##   Scaled rather than fixed so everything meant to read at horizon
    ##   (`tessellate.radiusHorizonFor`, `tessellate.extentFurnitureFor`, far end of
    ##   every drawn line) stays past what frame shows at any orbit distance.
    ##   Fixed plane cannot: view's extent grows with distance while plane does not, so
    ##   dollying out brings line's far end inside frame, and clips target away once eye
    ##   orbits past it.
  FRACTION_VIEW_CENTRED* = 2.0/3.0
    ## Fix fraction of frame that counts as being looked at.
    ##   This much of height, and this much of width *or height, whichever is less*;
    ##   `reachCentred` writes that shape down.
    ##   Box rather than whole frame: object clinging to edge is on screen without being
    ##   what view is about, and marker ringing it is half off-frame.
    ##   Not exact middle: selection is *framed* inside box, spread across it.
    ##   Here rather than beside pixel test in `picking` because camera needs it too, to
    ##   solve how far back eye must stand (`distanceFitting`), and `picking` imports this.
  FACTOR_CLIP_NEAR* = 1.0/400.0
    ## Set near clip plane this fraction of orbit distance out.
    ##   Scaled beside `FACTOR_CLIP_FAR` so frustum stays same shape at every distance,
    ##   holding depth-buffer precision, function of far-to-near ratio, constant.

  ## Fix rates held key moves camera at, per second of holding.
  ##   Shared by both front-ends, unlike per-pixel drag rates: `visualiser.SPEED_ORBIT` is
  ##   radians per pixel and `glue.js` works in fractions of canvas width. Held key has no
  ##   pixels in it.
  ##   Per second, not per press.
  ##     Per-press steps leaned on operating system's auto-repeat: movement began after
  ##     repeat delay and arrived in stutters.
  ##     `interaction.driveHeld` applies these once per frame, scaled by elapsed time, so
  ##     distance depends on hold length, not draw rate.
  ##   Sized so reader crosses useful range in second or two of holding, while still
  ##   controllable in short taps.
  TURN_SECOND* = 1.4 ## Azimuth held arrow turns through per second, in radians.
  RISE_SECOND* = 1.1 ## Elevation held arrow rises through per second, in radians.
  SLIDE_SECOND* = 1.2 ## Ground distance held key slides per second, as fraction of orbit.
    ## Reader zoomed onto one object crosses it at same apparent speed as one viewing
    ## whole scene.
  FACTOR_DOLLY_SECOND* = 4.0 ## Orbit distance held key scales by per second, dollying out.
    ## Reciprocal dollies in, so second each way returns exactly.
    ## Compounded as power of elapsed seconds, never multiplied per frame: per-frame
    ## scale would move 144 Hz reader more than twice as far as 60 Hz one.
  FACTOR_HASTE* = 4.0 ## Multiply every rate above by this while shift is held.
    ## Shift means *faster* on every movement key rather than something different on
    ## each: what Blender, Unity, Unreal and Godot all do.
