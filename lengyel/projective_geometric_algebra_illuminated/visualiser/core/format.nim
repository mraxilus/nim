## Format numbers into fixed char storage without touching heap.
##
## Nim's `$` and `strformat` produce heap-allocated `string`; C's `snprintf` writes into
## storage caller owns. Every visible item's coefficients are redrawn once per item per
## frame, so difference is allocator call per number against none.
##
## Sits beside `sdl3`, `opengl` and `image` as binding over something external -- C
## runtime's formatter -- rather than beside `scene` or `mesh`.
##
## `snprintf` is C entry point, so browser build cannot reach it. What magnitude should
## *read* as is project's own rule, so `formatMagnitude` states it in plain Nim for that
## build, and `magnitudesAgree` in suite holds two to same answer.
##
## Shared by desktop (`visualiser.nim`) and browser (`browser_bridge.nim`) render paths,
## transitively through `interaction`.
