## Bridge interactive RGA panel to WebGL front end, compiled through Nim's JS backend.
##
## Every join, meet, attitude, support, expansion, projection, pick and drag browser
## offers is computed by same modules desktop draws through.
##   `pga`, `objects`, `mesh`, `camera`, `scene`, `picking`, `interaction` and
##   `storyboard`.
##   Only presentation (WebGL calls, DOM, pointer input) is JS's own, as OpenGL/SDL/Dear
##   ImGui are desktop's presentation over same CPU-side geometry.
## Full parity with desktop.
##   Add point, apply any catalogue operation to two picked operands, drag from one object
##   onto another to derive third, edit any object's label, palette slot, visibility or
##   raw coefficients, remove object, save or load scene, and orbit/pan/dolly camera by
##   drag or typed numbers.
##   Entire surface `panel.nim` lays out for Dear ImGui, offered as exported procs
##   hand-written presentation layer drives.
## Not carried over: `scene.toCstring`, `format.appendMagnitude` and every desktop-only
## diagnostic.
##   Arena accounting and SDL/OpenGL loop timing depend on C FFI or on addresses JS has
##   no notion of.
##   What coefficient should read as is this project's rule, so `nimFormatNumber` answers
##   from `format.formatMagnitude` rather than JS `toFixed`.
##   Browser diagnostics substitute (frame time via `requestAnimationFrame`, JS heap where
##   available) covers same purpose without pretending to same numbers.
## Desktop's file-path save/load becomes browser download/upload of identical `.rgascene`
## binary; see `scene.nim`.
##   This module exposes raw per-item fields rather than bytes, since packing IEEE-754
##   doubles by hand in Nim/JS would reinvent browser's `DataView`.
##
## Browser entry point; see `visualiser.nim`'s "Render Paths" table for module split.
