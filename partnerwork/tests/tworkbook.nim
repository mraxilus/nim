## Test the model against the workbook it was read from.
##
## The workbook is an independent reference: it was written by hand, before the
## model existed.  Every filled cell of the `base` sheet that holds between two
## hand-to-hand frames must agree with the primitive the model derives for the
## same pair, and the cells that wait for a place on the body are pinned here so
## that the size of what is deferred stays visible.
