## Assert the claims the eye cannot check, instead of trusting them.
##
##   Everything the pages argue is here as a test: the hands land where the
##     rules put them, an orbit collapses onto the matching axis turn mark
##     for mark, every cycle closes, no reach enters a body, a bare border
##     carries no arm ink, and the sign's geometry is even to the tenth of a
##     unit.
##   Each page's checker is the ledger made executable: one block per rule,
##     each opening with the rule in the words it was given, each printing
##     one line on every build.  A rule that is only implemented and not
##     asserted is a rule that quietly stops being true, which has happened
##     here more than once.
##     Cost of a spoken ledger: a line of build noise per rule per page, and
##       there are twenty-nine of them now.  Accepted -- the noise is the
##       receipt.
